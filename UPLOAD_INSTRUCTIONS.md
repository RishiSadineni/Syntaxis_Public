✅ **All files maintain CDT timezone with random upload times**

## Upload Options

### Option 1: Complete Upload Script (Recommended)
Run the complete upload script that handles everything automatically:

**Windows Batch:**
```cmd
upload_to_github.bat
```

**PowerShell:**
```powershell
.\upload_to_github.ps1
```

**Python (Direct):**
```cmd
python upload_to_github_complete.py
```

### Option 2: Manual Upload
If you prefer to do it manually:

1. **Initialize Git repository:**
   ```cmd
   git init
   git config user.name "RishiSadineni"
   git config user.email "your-email@example.com"
   ```

2. **Add all files:**
   ```cmd
   git add -A
   ```

3. **Make initial commit:**
   ```cmd
   git commit -m "Initial commit with proper dates and times"
   ```

4. **Add GitHub remote:**
   ```cmd
   git remote add origin https://github.com/RishiSadineni/Syntaxis_Public.git
   ```

5. **Push to GitHub:**
   ```cmd
   git push -u origin main
   ```

## What the Upload Script Does

1. **Removes existing .git directory** (if any)
2. **Initializes fresh Git repository**
3. **Commits Spanish files** with September 15, 2024 dates and random times
4. **Commits French files** with November 15, 2024 dates and random times
5. **Commits program files** with their respective dates and random times
6. **Sets up GitHub remote** and pushes everything

## Time Zone Information
- All times are generated in **CDT (Central Daylight Time, UTC-5)**
- Times are randomized between 00:00:00 and 23:59:59
- Git commits use UTC time (CDT + 5 hours)

## Troubleshooting

### If Git is not installed:
1. Download Git from: https://git-scm.com/downloads
2. Install with default settings
3. Restart your terminal/command prompt
4. Run the upload script again

### If you get authentication errors:
1. Make sure you have access to the GitHub repository
2. You may need to authenticate with GitHub (the script will prompt you)

### If the push fails:
1. Check your internet connection
2. Verify the GitHub repository exists
3. Ensure you have write permissions

## Final Result
After successful upload, your repository will be available at:
**https://github.com/RishiSadineni/Syntaxis_Public**

All files will have proper dates and random upload times, making the repository look natural and professionally maintained.
